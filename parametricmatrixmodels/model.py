class Model(BaseModule):
    r"""

    Abstract base class for all models. Do not instantiate this class directly.

    A ``Model`` is a PyTree of modules that can be trained and
    evaluated. Inputs are passed through each module to produce
    outputs. ``Model`` s are also ``BaseModule`` s, so they can be
    nested inside other models.

    For confidence intervals or uncertainty quantification, wrap a trained
    model with ``ConformalModel``.

                (batch_size, input_height, input_width, input_channels) for a
                3D input.
            dtype
                Data type of the output array. Default is jax.numpy.float64.
                It is strongly recommended to perform training in single
                precision (float32 and complex64) and inference with double
                precision inputs (float64, the default here) with single
                precision weights. Default is float64.
            rng
                JAX random key for stochastic modules. Default is None.
                If None, the saved rng key will be used if it exists, which
                would be the final rng key from the last training run. If an
                integer is provided, it will be used as the seed to create a
                new JAX random key. Default is the saved rng key if it exists,
                otherwise a new random key will be generated.
            return_state
                If True, the model will return the state of the model after
                evaluation. Default is ``False``.
            update_state
                If True, the model will update the state of the model after
                evaluation. Default is ``False``.
            max_batch_size
                If provided, the input will be split into batches of at most
                this size and processed sequentially to avoid OOM errors.
                Default is ``None``, which means the input will be processed in
                a single batch.

                Output data as a PyTree of JAX arrays, the structure and shape

        ----------
        fwd
            If True, use ``jax.jacfwd``, otherwise use ``jax.jacrev``. Default
            is ``None``, which decides based on the input and output shapes.
        max_batch_size
            If provided, the input will be split into batches of at most
            this size and processed sequentially to avoid OOM errors.
            Default is ``None``, which means the input will be processed in
            a single batch. If ``max_batch_size`` is set to ``1``, the gradient
            will be computed one sample at a time without batching. This case
            is particularly important for ``grad_input`` since the Jacobian
            contains gradients across different batch samples and thus scales
            with the square of the batch size.

        Returns
        -------
            PyTree
                Gradient of the model output with respect to the input data,
                as a PyTree of JAX arrays, the structure of which matches that
                of the output structure of the model composed above the input
                data structure. Each leaf array will have shape
                (num_samples, output_dim1, output_dim2, ..., input_dim1,
                input_dim2, ...), where the output dimensions correspond to
                the shape of the model output for that leaf, and the input
                dimensions correspond to the shape of the input data for that
                leaf.
            ModelState
                If ``return_state`` is ``True``, the state of the model after
                evaluation as a PyTree of PyTrees of JAX arrays, the structure
                of which matches that of the model's modules.
